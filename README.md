# Image-Visualization-and-Processing
This Python script showcases image visualization and basic processing techniques using the popular computer vision libraries, OpenCV and Matplotlib. The script covers functionalities such as displaying images with Matplotlib and OpenCV, plotting image histograms, visualizing RGB channels, and resizing images.
# Functions:
## 1. display_image_with_matplotlib:
Displays an image using Matplotlib.
Optional parameters:
title: Title of the plot.
figsize: Size of the plot.
cmap: Colormap for displaying the image.
axis_off: Turns off axis labels if set to True.
## 2. display_image_with_cv2:
Displays an image using OpenCV.
Converts the image to BGR format if it's in RGB format.
## 3. plot_image_histogram:
Plots the histogram of pixel intensities in the image using Pandas and Matplotlib.
## 4. display_rgb_channels:
Displays the individual RGB channels of an image using Matplotlib.
## 5. display_images_cv2_vs_matplotlib:
Compares and displays images using OpenCV and Matplotlib side by side.
## 6. resize_and_display_image:
Resizes an image using OpenCV and displays the resized image using Matplotlib.
Optional parameters:
target_size: Target size for resizing.
interpolation: Interpolation method for resizing.

# Purpose:
This script serves as a practical guide for beginners to understand fundamental image visualization techniques and the interoperability between OpenCV and Matplotlib. Feel free to customize the text to better fit the context and details of your project.
